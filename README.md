# Marvellous CVFS

**Marvellous CVFS** is a simple in-memory virtual file system implemented in C/C++. It simulates basic file system operations and provides a shell-like interface to manage files with permissions, file descriptors, and error handling.  

---

## Features

- **In-Memory File Storage:** Files are stored in memory using dynamic buffers.  
- **File Operations:** Create, read, write, delete, list, and display file statistics (`creat`, `read`, `write`, `unlink`, `ls`, `stat`).  
- **Shell Interface:** Custom CLI supporting commands like `help`, `man`, `clear`, and `exit`.  
- **Permissions & Error Handling:** Read/write permissions, invalid parameters, insufficient space, and other common file system errors.  
- **File Management:** Uses inodes and file tables to track file metadata and open file descriptors.  
- **Educational Purpose:** Demonstrates OS-level file management concepts and data structures.
